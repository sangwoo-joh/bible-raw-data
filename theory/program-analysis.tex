\chapter{Program Analysis}
\begin{chapquote}{H.G. Rice [1953], \textit{paraphrased by Anders Moller}}
  ``Everything interesting about the behaviour of programs is
  undecidable.''
\end{chapquote}

The goal of \textit{static program analysis} is to verify specific
properties (or behaviours) of the target program \textbf{without its
  execution}.

For program \textsl{P} and property (specification) \textsl{S},

\begin{itemize}
\item $ [|P|] $: Formal semantics of program \textsl{P}.

\item \textsl{S}: Semantic properties that we're interested in. This
  could be defined in various level, such as ``Division-by-zero will
  \textbf{never} occur'' or ``The variable \textit{i} is always 3''.

\item Soundness: $ analysis(P) = true \implies S $, in other words, if
  an analysis for program \textsl{P} says that it satisfies property
  \textsl{S}, then the program will truly satisfy that property.

\item Completeness: $ S \implies analysis(P) = true $, in other words,
  if a program satisfies a property \textsl{S}, then the analysis for
  that program says that it will satisfy that property.

\item Scalability: Time complexity.
\end{itemize}


\section{Semantics}
\label{sec:semantics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Operational Semantics: transitional
\item Denotational Semantics: compositional
\end{itemize}
